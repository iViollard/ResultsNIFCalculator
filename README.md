#rankingscalculator

To run the Python scripts:
1 open terminal
2 change directory (cd) to the relevant folder
3 run python test.py

What it does so far:

- gets latest ranking file from BFA website
- gets multipliers for www.cmollard.co.uk
- write both to new files
- creates a new results file
- in the new results file: gets NIF value for each fencer and lists it; sums them; adds a new column with "test" in each cell
